# IBA1+ Cells Following Spinal Cord Injury

## Quantification of IBA1+ cells in histological sections of the injured spinal cord

**Aim:** Estimate the IBA1+ cell content per treatment and time point.  

**Study design:** A 75 kdyn spinal injury (SCI) was delivered to mice. Allogenic or syngeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were transplanted to the spinal cord 24h post SCI. Fixed spinal cords were sectioned and stained for IBA1.   

**Statistical analysis**

* Average number of IBA1+ cells was calculated and reported.  
 
* *Assumptions:* Normality was evaluated using Shapiro Wilk's test. Homogenity of variances was evaluated using Fligner Killeen's test.   

* *Multiple group comparison:* One way ANOVA was used given that data was normally distributed and variances were equal. Given that data was or was not normally distributed but variances were not equal Kruskal Wallis H test was used instead.   

* *Post hoc testing:* One-way ANOVA was evaluated post hoc using Tukey's post hoc test. Kruskal Wallis H test was evaluated post hoc using pair-wise Mann Whitney U tests with holm bonferroni correction.
